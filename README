* What is JMud?

    JMud is a Java MUD server that aims to be easily extensible and platform independent. The ultimate goal of the project is to have an easy to install server with a full set of tools for item, creature, and map management.

* The Project So Far

    Development on JMud has just started, and the preliminary design is still underway. Nevertheless, a simple server that accepts clients has already been implemented along with simple message handling between the server and clients. The server currently supports a limited number of commands that allow users to chat with each other and leave the server gracefully.

* Features

    - Server that accepts client connections
    - Messaging between server and clients
    - Limited client commands

* TODO

    A lot. There is a lot to do. As work progresses, the project will take on more direction and hopefully become a much more useful software system.
